"""
Real-time scheduler for stock signal prediction system.

This module provides a high-level interface for scheduling and running
market data collection jobs during trading hours.

Features:
- Market hours awareness (only runs during NYSE trading hours)
- Holiday calendar integration (skips non-trading days)
- Structured JSON logging for analytics and monitoring
- Optimized data downloads (full history for new tickers, incremental for existing)
- Retry logic for network failures
- Rich terminal UI with progress indicators
- Graceful shutdown handling with Ctrl+C
