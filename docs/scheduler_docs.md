# Stock Data Scheduler System

## Overview

The scheduler system is a robust, production-grade solution for managing the periodic download and processing of stock market data. It's designed to be reliable, maintainable, and easy to monitor.

## Core Components

### 1. Scheduler Module (`scheduler.py`)
- Manages the main scheduling logic
- Handles job execution and error handling
- Provides a clean interface for starting/stopping the scheduler
- Implements graceful shutdown procedures

### 2. Job Runner (`job_runner.py`)
- Manages the execution of data download jobs
- Handles job queuing and execution
- Implements progress tracking and reporting
- Manages job timeouts and retries

### 3. Data Manager (`data_manager.py`)
- Handles all data-related operations
- Downloads historical and real-time data
- Processes and normalizes data for storage
- Manages database interactions

## Features

### Data Collection
- **Flexible Scheduling**: Configurable cron-style scheduling
- **Efficient Downloads**: Only downloads new data points
- **Robust Error Handling**: Continues processing other tickers if one fails
- **Data Validation**: Ensures data quality before storage

### System Architecture
- **Modular Design**: Clear separation of concerns
- **Thread-Safe Operations**: Safe for concurrent execution
- **Resource Management**: Efficient memory and CPU usage
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/stock_data
LOG_LEVEL=INFO
```

### Scheduler Settings
```python
{
    "tickers": ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL"],
    "interval": "5m",
    "period": "20d",
    "timezone": "US/Eastern"
}
```

## Usage

### Starting the Scheduler
```bash

```

### API Endpoints (if applicable)
- `GET /status`: Check scheduler status
- `POST /start`: Start the scheduler
- `POST /stop`: Stop the scheduler gracefully
- `GET /jobs`: List scheduled jobs

## Error Handling

The system implements comprehensive error handling:
- **Network Issues**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Data Validation**: Skips invalid data points and logs issues
- **Database Errors**: Transaction management to prevent data corruption
- **Resource Limits**: Memory and CPU usage monitoring

## Monitoring

### Logs
- All operations are logged with appropriate severity levels
- Structured logging for easy parsing and analysis

### Metrics
- Jobs executed
- Data points processed
- Error rates
- Execution times

## Best Practices

1. **Idempotency**: All operations are designed to be idempotent
2. **Stateless Design**: Each job is independent
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation with reduced functionality when possible
4. **Audit Trail**: All changes are logged for auditing

## Maintenance

### Common Tasks
- **Adding New Tickers**: Update the configuration
- **Adjusting Schedule**: Modify the cron expression
- **Troubleshooting**: Check logs in `logs/scheduler.log`

### Performance Tuning
- Adjust batch sizes for database operations
- Tune the number of concurrent jobs
- Configure appropriate timeouts

## Security

- All database credentials are stored securely
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Secure communication channels for API endpoints

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- APScheduler
- Pandas
- SQLAlchemy
- Rich (for console output)
- yfinance (for market data)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Connection Timeouts**: Check network connectivity and database status
2. **Data Gaps**: Verify the data source and check for market holidays
3. **Performance Issues**: Monitor system resources and adjust batch sizes
